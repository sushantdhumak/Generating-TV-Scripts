## Project Overview

In this project, we'll generate our own Simpsons TV scripts using Recurrent Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks. 
Weâ€™ll generate new text, and use recurrent networks to generate new text that resembles a training set of TV scripts. 
We'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network we'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
